It seems that the bash script provided by the university does not work for my machine with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
For a wireless connection through VPN to be able to be "on campus", you can follow the easy steps listed below. 
* Download the configuration at [here](http://www.ccs.uottawa.ca/download/support/vpn-linux/empl.pcf). 
You must be on campus to download it.
* Run the following commends in the location where you saved the configuration file:
```
pcf2vpnc empl.pcf  empl.conf  
sudo cp empl.conf /etc/vpnc/  
sudo vpnc empl  
```
* If previous commands go well, you will be asked to provide username and account. 
(You can also hard code username and password in empl.conf file by uncommenting 
Xauth username
Xauth password)

* To disconnect, type `sudo vpnc-disconnect`
