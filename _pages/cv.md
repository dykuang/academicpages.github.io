I am currently a postdoc fellow in the Data Science and Machine Learning group of UOttawa's Math & Stats department. I have a broad interest in mathematical modelling and data analysis. My current duties includes utilizing theories from geometries and mechanics for feature extraction tasks and developing registration/learning tools for making inferences from medical images. I am relatively new to this field and am learning new things everyday in this promising field.
