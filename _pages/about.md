Hello, welcome to my personal site. This site is still under construction. I will add contents bit by bit in the short future. Thank you for your patience :). In the meantime, please check the following simulations I made about geodesics on some special surfaces.

### One geodesic on a revolutional ellipzoid ###

### Another geodesic on the same revolutional ellipzoid ###

### Different geodesics on the surface f(x, y) = exp(-x^2/2-y^2)  ###
